Hi! I'm 2s , a passionate full-stack developer located in Toronto. My passion for software development comes from the accessibility of digital devices and "code won't lie". I enjoy learning new technologies in my spare time and is interested in building useful softwares.

Currently I am looking for new-grad SWE role for 2023, either located in Canada or remote. I have done an internship with Intel, working on compiler features, and I will be doing SWE internships with Hudson River Trading & Meta for summer & fall 2022. I have extensive experience building frontend & backend softwares, as well as system softwares using Python & C++.
